# Sub Strings

In this project, I implemented a method that takes one or more words as the first argument, and an array of words to test for as the second argument. It returns a hash listing all the matching words from the second argument and the amount of times it matched. It is case-insensitive.

Some interesting lessons I learned inlcude:
* Converting a **string to array** and vice versa
* Creating a new **hash from an array**
* Using **reduce** with a default value of a new hash
* Understanding reduce's **default value**
* Understanding the role of the **accumulator** in the reduce method
